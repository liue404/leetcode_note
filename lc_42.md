There are two key points while solving this problem:

1. For any position i, the water it can contain ONLY depend on its "left max" and "right max".
2. So the problem is converted to another problem that, how to get left and right max or any position i
   1. Left to right and vice versa, right to left, to compute left max array and right max array
   2. The two pointer method's beauty is that, only using two variable to maintain left max and right max. And by comparing these two, we can determine how much water position i can contain.
